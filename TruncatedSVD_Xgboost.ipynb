      "I have been fortunate enough to use the Fairy Tale STEM kits in my classroom as well as the STEM journals, which my students really enjoyed.  I would love to implement more of the Lakeshore STEM kits in my classroom for the next school year as they provide excellent and engaging STEM lessons.My students come from a variety of backgrounds, including language and socioeconomic status.  Many of them don't have a lot of experience in science and engineering and these kits give me the materials to provide these exciting opportunities for my students.Each month I try to do several science or STEM/STEAM projects.  I would use the kits and robot to help guide my science instruction in engaging and meaningful ways.  I can adapt the kits to my current language arts pacing guide where we already teach some of the material in the kits like tall tales (Paul Bunyan) or Johnny Appleseed.  The following units will be taught in the next school year where I will implement these kits: magnets, motion, sink vs. float, robots.  I often get to these units and don't know If I am teaching the right way or using the right materials.    The kits will give me additional ideas, strategies, and lessons to prepare my students in science.It is challenging to develop high quality science activities.  These kits give me the materials I need to provide my students with science activities that will go along with the curriculum in my classroom.  Although I have some things (like magnets) in my classroom, I don't know how to use them effectively.  The kits will provide me with the right amount of materials and show me how to use them in an appropriate way.\n"
